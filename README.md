# Agriculture Crop Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing agriculture crop data, including data loading, exploration, and visualization. The code is written in Python and utilizes popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Files

- `CROP.csv`: Main dataset containing information about crop yields, costs, and production for multiple years.
- `CROP1.csv`, `CROP2.csv`, `CROP3.csv`: Additional datasets used for specific analyses.
- `datafile1.csv`: A dataset with renamed columns for consistency.

## Code Structure

1. **Exploration and Loading:**
   - The code starts by exploring files in the '/Agriculture Crop/input' directory.
   - Essential libraries are imported, and the main dataset (`CROP.csv`) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Initial data exploration includes displaying the first and last few rows of the dataset.
   - Multiple datasets are loaded and renamed for consistency.
   - Data shape, columns, information, and summary statistics are displayed.
   - Null values in the data are handled by filling with zeros.
   - Duplicate values are checked and handled.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Various visualizations are created to analyze cost-related information for each crop.
   - Plotly is used to visualize crop growth over time.
   - Subplots and different plot types (line plot, bar plot, histogram) are employed for diverse visualizations.

4. **Crop Production Analysis:**
   - Crop production data is loaded and visualized using Matplotlib.

5. **Recommended Zone Analysis:**
   - A dataset (`CROP3.csv`) containing recommended zones for crops is processed, and state-wise columns are added.

6. **Miscellaneous Visualizations:**
   - Additional visualizations include scatter plots, pie charts, and bar plots.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook or script.
